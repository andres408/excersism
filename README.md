Raindrops:Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder. The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the modulo operation.

The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:

has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
does not have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.
Examples
28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".

Ellen's Alien Game
Instructions
Ellen is making a game where the player has to fight aliens. She has just learned about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and is eager to take advantage of what using classes could offer her program.

To Ellen's delight, you have offered to help and she has given you the task of programming the aliens that the player has to fight.

Task 1
Create the Alien Class

Define the Alien class with a constructor that accepts two parameters <x_coordinate> and <y_coordinate>, putting them into x_coordinate and y_coordinate instance variables. Every alien will also start off with a health level of 3, so the health variable should be initialized as well.

>>> alien = Alien(2, 0)
>>> alien.x_coordinate
2
>>> alien.y_coordinate
0
>>> alien.health
3
Now, each alien should be able to internally track its own position and health.


Task 2
The hit Method

Ellen would like the Alien class to have a hit method that decrements the health of an alien object by 1 when called. This way, she can simply call <alien>.hit() instead of having to manually change an alien's health. It is up to you if hit() takes healths points to or below zero.

>>> alien = Alien(0, 0)
>>> alien.health

# Initialized health value.
3

# Decrements health by 1 point.
>>> alien.hit()
>>> alien.health
2


Task 3
The is_alive Method

You realize that if the health keeps decreasing, at some point it will probably hit 0 (or even less!). It would be a good idea to add an is_alive method that Ellen can quickly call to check if the alien is... well... alive. ðŸ˜‰ <alien>.is_alive() should return a boolean.

>>> alien.health
1
>>> alien.is_alive()
True
>>> alien.hit()
>>> alien.health
0
>>> alien.is_alive()
False

Task 4
The teleport Method

In Ellen's game, the aliens have the ability to teleport! You will need to write a teleport method that takes new x_coordinate and y_coordinate values, and changes the alien's coordinates accordingly.

>>> alien.teleport(5, -4)
>>> alien.x_coordinate
5
>>> alien.y_coordinate
-4

Task 5
The collision_detection Method

Obviously, if the aliens can be hit by something, then they need to be able to detect when such a collision has occurred. However, collision detection algorithms can be tricky, and you do not yet know how to implement one. Ellen has said that she will do it later, but she would still like the collision_detection method to appear in the class as a reminder to build out the functionality. It will need to take a variable of some kind (probably another object), but that's really all you know. You will need to make sure that putting the method definition into the class doesn't cause any errors when called:

>>> alien.collision_detection(other_object)
>>>

Task 6
Alien Counter

Ellen has come back with a new request for you. She wants to keep track of how many aliens have been created over the game's lifetime. She says that it's got something to do with the scoring system.

For example:

>>> alien_one = Alien(5, 1)
>>> alien_one.total_aliens_created
1
>>> alien_two = Alien(3, 0)
>>> alien_two.total_aliens_created
2
>>> alien_one.total_aliens_created
2
>>> Alien.total_aliens_created
# Accessing the variable from the class directly
2

Task 7
Object Creation

Ellen loves what you've done so far, but she has one more favor to ask. She would like a standalone function to create a list of alien objects, given a list of positions (as tuples).

For example:

>>> alien_start_positions = [(4, 7), (-1, 0)]
>>> aliens = new_aliens_collection(alien_start_positions)
>>> for alien in aliens:
    	print(alien.x_coordinate, alien.y_coordinate)
(4, 7)
(-1, 0)

Triangle
Instructions
Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.

An isosceles triangle has at least two sides the same length. (It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)

A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.

Note
For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

In equations:

Let a, b, and c be sides of the triangle. Then all three of the following expressions must be true:

a + b â‰¥ c
b + c â‰¥ a
a + c â‰¥ b

GRAINS

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board, with the number of grains doubling on each successive square.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard (where square 1 has one grain, square 2 has two grains, and so on).

Write code that shows:

how many grains were on a given square, and
the total number of grains on the chessboard


SUBLISTS

Given any two lists A and B, determine if:

List A is equal to list B; or
List A contains list B (A is a superlist of B); or
List A is contained by list B (A is a sublist of B); or
None of the above is true, thus lists A and B are unequal
Specifically, list A is equal to list B if both lists have the same values in the same order. List A is a superlist of B if A contains a sub-sequence of values equal to B. List A is a sublist of B if B contains a sub-sequence of values equal to A.

Examples:

If A = [] and B = [] (both lists are empty), then A and B are equal
If A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [], then A is a superlist of B
If A = [] and B = [1, 2, 3], then A is a sublist of B
If A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then A is a sublist of B
If A = [3, 4, 5] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then A is a sublist of B
If A = [3, 4] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then A is a sublist of B
If A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [1, 2, 3], then A and B are equal
If A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and B = [2, 3, 4], then A is a superlist of B
If A = [1, 2, 4] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then A and B are unequal
If A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [1, 3, 2], then A and B are unequal
